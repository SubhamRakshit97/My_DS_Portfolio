# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Bike_Rental_Demand.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**94%** accuracy](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Bike_Rental_Demand.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration -->

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Haile143/Portu_bank_Logistic_Regessesion)

<img src="images/LR.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**98%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/Haile143/Portu_bank_Logistic_Regessesion).

- Used logistic regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on given independent features.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis.

[Orthopedic Patients Prediction](https://github.com/Haile143/Orthopedic_KNN)

<img src="images/OP.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project we predicted normal and abnormal status of patient based on orthopedic parameters using KNN and NB algorithm.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the data with KNN algo to attain a accuracy of [**91%**](https://github.com/Haile143/Orthopedic_KNN).

- Used KNN and NB to predict if patient has disease or not.
- Compared Best Algorithm.
- Explored machine learning approach to Medical Data.

[Talking Data Fraud Detection with Ensemble Technique](https://github.com/Haile143/Talking_Data_Ensemble)

<img src="images/FD.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click etc. to predict the probability of a click being fraud.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict whether a given click resulted in a download or not. The Accuracy of Boosting technique is [**92%** ](https://github.com/Haile143/Talking_Data_Ensemble) And accuracy of Baaging is [**99%** ](https://github.com/Haile143/Talking_Data_Ensemble).

- Used XGBoost Classifier algo to classify the people who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting Bagging Classifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
- Explored Ensemble Technique.

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/Haile143/Cat_-_Dog_CNN)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**85%** using **25** epochs](https://github.com/Haile143/Cat_-_Dog_CNN).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
